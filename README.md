# Flower_Classifier

## General Information
This iOS app is aimed to help users when gardening, or anyone who would like to determine what the name of a flower they see is. 
The app uses a Caffe trained model within the CoreML framework to classify pictures of flowers. A user is then able to take a picture
of a flower and then the model will return the name of the flower, a picture, and a generic description which is retrieved by using the
wikipedia API.
